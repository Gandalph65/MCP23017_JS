# MCP23017_WE
This is a library for the MCP23017 I/O Port Expander

You'll find some examples including the wiring which should enable you to
use the library. Furthermore I have added a list of commands. 

You are free to use it, change it or build on it. In case you like it,
it would be cool if you give it a star.

If you find bugs, please inform me!
